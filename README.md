# soa_project
Project for Service Oriented Architectures classes in Java EE technology.


lacks mostly a few things: 1 session/user, rest protection(token), jms id for zones, data querying might be questionable(preffered more caching in front) umm.. 
also something is wrong with mobile notifications(all are deleted on change when 1 should be)
also probably something more, cheers:)
